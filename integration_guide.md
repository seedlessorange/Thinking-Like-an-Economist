# Integration Guide: Problem Set Answer Keys

## What I've Created

I've created a comprehensive HTML document (`problem_sets_with_answers.html`) that includes:

### ✅ Problem Set 2: Comparative Statics
- **Exercise 1:** News story analysis with 5 scenarios
  - Oil strike supply shock
  - Car market double shift
  - All with detailed graphs and economic reasoning
- **Exercise 2:** Ice cream market (6 scenarios)
  - Input price changes
  - Substitute goods
  - Income effects
  - Short-run vs. long-run supply
  - Price ceilings
  - Each with step-by-step analysis and interactive graphs

### ✅ Problem Set 3: International Trade & Industry Cost Curves
- **Main Event:** International trade analysis
  - Consumer and producer surplus in autarky
  - Effects of opening to trade
  - Gains from trade calculations
  - Political economy explanation (why trade is hard to sell)
  - Policy solutions (tariffs, competitiveness, transition assistance)
- **Exercise 3:** Paper industry cost curve (McKinsey article)
  - Merit-order dispatch
  - Profit calculations for each production unit
  - Strategic capacity decisions (Bravo expansion, Alpha 2 closure)
  - Capacity withholding strategy
  - All with detailed tables and graphs

### ✅ Problem Set 4: Price Elasticity & Strategic Pricing
- **Warm-up:** Elasticity concepts
  - Elastic vs. inelastic demand curves
  - Electricity: short-run vs. long-run elasticity
  - Time horizon effects
- **Main Event:** Apple iPhone pricing case
  - Justification: Dynamic pricing, price discrimination, behavioral economics
  - Critique: Price expectations, brand damage, credibility
  - Trade-offs between short-term profit and long-term strategy

### ✅ Problem Set 5: Platform Economics & Uber
- **Question 1:** Uber's evolution and competitive advantage
  - Timeline from luxury service to mass market
  - "Move fast and break things" strategy
  - Network effects and platform leverage
- **Question 2:** Sharing economy analysis
  - Definition and key characteristics
  - How Uber fits (underused assets, flexible labor, platform coordination)
  - Three microeconomic arguments:
    1. Marginal cost ≈ $0
    2. Platform matching supply and demand
    3. Efficiency of market design
  - Surge pricing as dynamic equilibrium
  - Counterarguments (full-time drivers, commercial purpose)

## Key Features

### 📊 Interactive Graphs
All major concepts have Chart.js visualizations:
- Supply and demand shifts
- Consumer and producer surplus areas
- Trade effects
- Industry cost curves
- Elasticity comparisons
- Dynamic pricing

### 🎯 Answer Structure
Each answer includes:
1. **Clear header** with ✓ icon
2. **Step-by-step analysis**
3. **Economic reasoning** bullets
4. **Graphs** to visualize concepts
5. **Key insights** in highlighted boxes
6. **Mathematical formulas** where relevant

### 💡 Key Insight Boxes
Special callouts for important concepts:
- Normal vs. inferior goods
- Short run vs. long run elasticity
- Capacity paradox
- Trade creates winners and losers
- Platform network effects

### 🎨 Design Features
- **Collapsible sections** - Click to expand/collapse each problem set
- **Navigation menu** - Jump to any problem set
- **Color coding:**
  - Questions: Gray background with purple left border
  - Answers: White with green border
  - Key insights: Yellow background with orange border
  - Graphs: Clean white containers

## How to Use

### Option 1: Standalone Study Tool
Open `problem_sets_with_answers.html` in your browser as a dedicated problem set resource.

### Option 2: Integration into Main Guide
You can copy sections from this file into your main `econ_study_guide.html` by:
1. Copying the relevant problem set sections
2. Ensuring Chart.js is loaded: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.min.js"></script>`
3. Including the graph initialization JavaScript at the bottom

## Missing Problem Sets

I noticed you have answer keys for:
- ✅ Problem Set 2 (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Problem Set 3 (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Problem Set 4 (COMPLETE - warm-up + main event)
- ✅ Problem Set 5 (COMPLETE - questions 1 & 2)

If you have additional problem sets or want me to expand on any section, let me know!

## Additional Insights from "Who Thinks Like an Economist" Document

I also reviewed the Mentimeter responses document. Key roles that think like economists in the private sector:

### Strategic Roles:
- **CEOs and C-suite executives** - Allocate scarce resources, maximize value under constraints
- **Management consultants** - Apply cost-benefit analysis, trade-off thinking
- **Business strategists** - Assess market dynamics, competition, incentives
- **Investment bankers and financial analysts** - Optimize capital allocation, risk-return trade-offs

### Operational Roles:
- **Product managers** - Balance revenue vs. market share, elasticity considerations
- **Pricing teams** - Dynamic pricing, price discrimination, elasticity analysis
- **Supply chain managers** - Optimize resource allocation, minimize costs

### Analytical Roles:
- **Data scientists** - Economic modeling, demand forecasting
- **Market researchers** - Consumer behavior, willingness to pay
- **Quantitative analysts** - Financial modeling, asset pricing

This reinforces that economic thinking is about:
1. **Scarcity** - Limited resources, tough choices
2. **Trade-offs** - Every decision has opportunity costs
3. **Incentives** - Understanding what drives behavior
4. **Marginal analysis** - Comparing incremental benefits vs. costs
5. **Market equilibrium** - Supply-demand balance

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Add more problem sets (e.g., Problem Set 6)?
2. Create more graphs for specific concepts?
3. Add practice problems with solutions?
4. Create a condensed "formula sheet" for quick reference?
5. Add more real-world examples to illustrate concepts?
